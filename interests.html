      <h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
      <p>My hobbies include swimming, cooking, and singing. I have swam competitively since the age of 7, and I only recently stopped once starting college. But with cooking and singing, I've continued my love for food through trying new restaurants, trying out new recipes, and bonding over food with my loved ones. With singing, it has always been a form of escape — from the hustling nature of the city, the stress that comes with being a student, and just calms me down and makes me happy.</p>

      <h2 id="future">Future Goals</h2>
      <p>Looking ahead, I’m passionate about healthcare administration and exploring how patient-centered care can be improved. I hope to continue exploring this field of public health in my academic and professional journey.</p>
      <p>One resource I often explore: <a href="https://www.who.int/" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a>.</p>
