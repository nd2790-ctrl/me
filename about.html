      <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Eva Deng. I’m currently a sophomore student at NYU with a passion in healthcare administration. This website will give you a brief introduction to who I am and what I love!</p>

    <section>
      <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
      <p>I grew up in Shanghai, China, and later moved to the United States for high school in New Jersey. Over the years, I’ve maintained my academic interest in the healthcare field, and soon developed a strong curiosity for the intersection between healthcare and business management. This journey has allowed me to explore a different side of healthcare I had never previously considered.</p>

      <p>A highlight I'd like to share under this section is traveling. My favorite places I've traveled to are Maldives, Greece, Thailand, and Hawaii. Growing up, my family loved to travel — we would go to at least one new country per year. I've always loved the winter season, but for some reason, these warm, tropical places never failed to amaze me. These places hold the most beautiful memories for me, whether that's with my family or my friends.</p>
